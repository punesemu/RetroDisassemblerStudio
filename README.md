# About Retro Disassembler Studio

RDS (Retro Disassembler Studio) aims to be a complete disassembler tool for
retro systems.  Currently, the only supported system is the Nintendo
Entertainment System (NES) but others are planned for the future.

RDS includes an emulator and disassembler and aims to make it easy to annotate
source code for old games.
